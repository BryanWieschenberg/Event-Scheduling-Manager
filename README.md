# Event-Scheduling-Manager
Created by Bryan Wieschenberg

This program finds and schedules rooms for events with specific constraints, given a list of rooms and reservations. The program was originally built for creating a Hackathon schedule, but can be used for general-purpose event-scheduling.

The program finds rooms based on a variety of constraints, including the creation of a mandatory opening and closing session, work and meal periods split across multiple rooms if necessary, finding rooms with computers since not all people attending the event may have one, and finding rooms in close proximinity to each other (i.e., in the same building).

This program schedules rooms for events through a robust, well-designed algorithm that carefully chooses rooms based on certain criteria, making sure to avoid colliding events in the same space.
